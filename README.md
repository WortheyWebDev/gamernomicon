# Gamernomicon

## Description
One of my first projects, Gamernomicon is my personal tracker for upcoming video game releases. I designed it to provide information at-a-glance in a way that showcases the striking cover art for each game. Updates to the site are automated through a JavaScript function that checks today's date against a game's release date and changes the corresponding graphic of the game from black and white to full color, and replaces the listed release date with "Released."

## Features
- **Clean and Simple Design:** Emphasizes colorful video game art contrasted against a dark, slick background.  
- **Automated Updates:** Automatically verifies release dates and alters the content of the page accordingly.
- **Smooth Navigation:** Simple navigation menu allows users to jump between months.
